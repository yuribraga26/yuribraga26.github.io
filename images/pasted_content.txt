PROMPT FOR AI WEBSITE BUILDER
0) Project Summary

Create a fast, accessible, single-owner personal portfolio for Yuri Braga — computer engineer and CareFuse co-founder — focused on:

Healthcare ML (explainable logistic models for TKA vs. conservative care, calibrated and propensity-weighted, AUC ≈ 0.87 via 50 multi-seed holdout runs, API-ready for insurer audits),

Embedded/robotics work (DeWALT, TREC Lab, CMAR),

Leadership & campus involvement (VT ECE Ambassadors; Cru, BYX; club soccer),

A compelling personal story (soccer injury resilience essay) that ties into patient safety and MCID-first philosophy.

The site must feel clean, professional, and recruitable, with simple visual polish, strong readability, and clear CTAs.

1) Tech & Delivery Requirements

Stack (preferred): Next.js 14 + TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Vercel deploy, React Server Components where sensible.

Design system:

Fonts: Inter for UI, Merriweather or Source Serif Pro for long-form (Personal Life page).

Color palette: neutral slate/stone grays with warm accents; optional maroon/orange accent (subtle, VT-inspired).

Components: responsive Nav, Hero, Stat (AUC/validation), Timeline, Card, FeatureList, Testimonial/Quote, ContactForm.

Performance & a11y:

CLS < 0.05, LCP < 2.5s on 4G; images lazy-loaded, next/image; color-contrast AA+; semantic landmarks; skip-to-content.

SEO & Analytics:

Dynamic meta per page, Open Graph, JSON-LD Person + Organization (CareFuse); sitemap.xml, robots.txt; basic analytics (Vercel/GA4).

Content management: Keep content in JSON/MDX for easy edits; no backend required for launch.

Contact form: static handler with formspree or serverless function (validations + spam honeypot).

Assets placeholders: headshot, company logos (generic), PDF resume links (we will upload).

Quote

“Surgery should prove benefit before we accept its risks. MCID-first thinking protects patients.”

/about

Short bio (150–200 words) connecting engineering + medicine; raised by doctors; mission to defend patients’ well-being with explainable, calibrated ML; belief in MCID-first decision logic (default null: surgery won’t reach MCID unless evidence shows otherwise).

Values list

Patient safety over model vanity metrics

Explainability for shared decision-making

Calibration, propensity weighting, and CI reporting

Ship robustly: schemas, versioned models, reproducible APIs

/carefuse

Section: What CareFuse Does (patient-first)

Plain English: We predict whether a patient is likely to achieve a meaningful clinical improvement (MCID) after Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) vs a conservative pathway.

If low chance of MCID with TKA, we highlight safer conservative options; if high chance, we convey expected benefit and risks.

Section: Model Design (reader-friendly bullets)

Dual-arm models: TKA vs Conservative

Features: age, BMI, baseline WOMAC subscales, ratios/derived features (see resume)

Propensity-score weighting to reduce confounding

Calibration: Platt (TKA) and isotonic (Conservative)

Thresholds: optimized by Youden’s J with transparent reporting

Validation: 50 multi-seed holdout + repeated CV; report AUC, Brier, ECE, cal slope/intercept

AUC ≈ 0.87 (TKA), robust CIs; SHAP-based top contributors

Deployment: Dockerized FastAPI, schema-validated inputs, saved thresholds, and JSON responses consumable by insurer audit systems.

Section: Example Output (mock JSON)

/personal

Long-form story: Use the provided essay as the backbone, with tasteful sub-heads:

The Injury (femur, epiphysis closure, prolonged rehab)

Rebuilding & Moving to the U.S. (expectations as the “Brazilian kid,” setbacks, perseverance)

Return & Growth (state championship, goosebumps moment, reframing adversity)

From Soccer to Patient Safety (how it forged your MCID-first stance: “prove benefit before risk”)

Today (CareFuse + engineering + faith/community → protecting patients from invasive procedures unlikely to reach MCID)

Tone: humble, reflective, resilient; connect to patient-first model philosophy.

8) Visual & Content Style Notes

Use clean spacing, generous line-height, and an obvious reading flow; hide complexity behind tooltips/expanders.

Keep graphs/metrics plain: AUC badge, 2–3 metric bullets; a small SHAP-style bar chart mock.

Avoid hospital/insurance logos; keep examples generic and de-identified.

9) Deliverables

Fully responsive site with all pages above, filled with the provided copy.

Downloadable PDF resumes (Firmware; ML-Healthcare) linked from /resume.

Contact form with validation + success/failure toasts.

SEO metadata & JSON-LD; sitemap/robots.

Source in a single repo with README for content updates.

10) Optional Enhancements (if time allows)

Dark mode toggle.

MDX blog for short method notes (MCID, calibration, PSW).

Minimal analytics dashboard (visits, resume downloads, contact submissions).
